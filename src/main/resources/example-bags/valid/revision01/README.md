revisions
=========

The bags revision01, revision02 and revision03 demonstrate how deposits can update existing datasets: revision01 creates a new
dataset and revision02 and revision03 create versions 2 and 3. 

In revision02 the available date is set to 2025. If, by the time you are reading this, this is still in the future, this would 
embargo any files added to the new version, either as new files or as replacements for existing files.
