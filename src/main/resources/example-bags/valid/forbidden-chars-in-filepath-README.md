forbidden-chars-in-filepath.zip
===============================

`forbidden-chars-in-filepath.zip` is zipped because some of the characters forbidden by Dataverse are also forbidden by some file systems, which would make it
impossible to clone this repository on such a file system. If your file system does support these characters, you can unzip the file and use the unzipped
version.
