Looking for legacy EASY SWORD2 examples? This project contains examples for the SWORD2 interface of the new DANS Data Stations . For the legacy EASY SWORD2 service see easy-sword2-dans-examples . Migrating from EASY SWORD2 to Data Station SWORD2 If you are an existing customer who is migrating an EASY SWORD2 client to a Data Station SWORD2 client, please read Migrating from EASY after you have read the current page. Data Station vs Vault as a Service Clients can deposit to either a Data Station or the Vault as a Service (Vaas). The protocol is largely the same. The differences are highlighted in the text with the notes (VaaS) and (Data Station) . SWORD2 in a nutshell \u00b6 Depositing to the DANS Archive via SWORD2 is basically a two-phase process: Submitting a deposit for ingest. Tracking the state of the deposit as it goes through the ingest-flow, until it reaches PUBLISHED or ACCEPTED status. The following diagram details this a bit further. Client creates a deposit package (conforming to DANS BagIt Profile v1 ). Client sends deposit package to SWORD2 Service, getting back a URL to track the deposit's state. SWORD2 Service unzips and validates deposit. Ingest Flow performs checks and transformations and creates a dataset in the Data Station Repository (Data Station) or submits an archival package directly to the DANS Data Vault (VaaS) . Ingest Flow reports back success or failure to SWORD2 Service. 3-5. During this time the Client periodically checks the deposit state through the URL received in step 2. If the final state of PUBLISHED (Data Station) / ACCEPTED (VaaS) is reached, the process is concluded successfully. At this point the deposit has published a new dataset (or a new version of an existing dataset) in the Data Station repository (Data Station only) and submitted an archival package to the DANS Data Vault for processing. Other outcomes may be INVALID (the bag was invalid according to the BagIt specs ) or REJECTED (the additional requirements of DANS BagIt Profile v1 were not met). In case the server encountered an unknown error FAILED will be returned. Getting started \u00b6 The following is a step-by-step instruction on how to run a simple example using the Data Station's demo server. Getting access to the demo server \u00b6 Agreement Before you can get access to the demo server, there must be a formal agreement between your organization and DANS. The following assumes that this agreement is in place. If it is not, please contact the Data Station Manager of the Data Station that you want to deposit to. From your Data Station Manager at DANS request access to the demo Data Station server. The Data Station Manager will provide the information necessary to connect (see note about the X-Authorization header below). Create an account in the demo Data Station (Data Station only) . From your Data Station Manager at DANS request the account to be enabled for SWORD2 deposits (Data Station only) . X-Authorization header In order to keep web crawlers from accessing the demo server, the demo server requires the X-Authorization header. This is in addition to the authentication required by the SWORD2 server. The value of the X-Authorization is provided by the Data Station Manager. It is the same for all users of the demo server. Put the value in a file called x-auth-value.txt in the root of your clone of this project. The method Common.addXAuthorizationToRequest() will read the value from this file and add it to the request. Configuring which notifications to receive The Data Station repository (Dataverse) generates notifications for many events. Most of these can be muted. Log in via the user interface and open the account menu on the top right. Click on the Notifications item. The Notifications tab of your Account page will now be opened. Expand the header Notification settings and uncheck the notification types you do not wish to receive. Depositing your first dataset \u00b6 Running the SimpleDeposit example \u00b6 Clone and build this project: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/dd-dans-sword2-examples cd dd-dans-sword2-examples mvn clean install Execute the following command from the base directory of your clone: ./run-simple-deposit.sh https://demo.sword2.<domain>.datastations.nl/collection/1 <user> <password> <bag> Fill in: for <domain> the name of the Data Station that you are depositing to, one of archaeology , ssh , lhms or pts ; for <user> your Data Station account name; for <password> the password of your Data Station account; for <bag> : any of the bags in src/main/resources/example-bags , for example src/main/resources/example-bags/valid/audiences . This will run the example program nl.knaw.dans.sword2examples.SimpleDeposit , which will copy the example bag to the folder target (the Maven build folder), zip it and send it to https://demo.sword2.<domain>.datastations.nl/collection/1 authenticating with the provider username and password using basic auth. Authenticating with X-Dataverse-key (Data Station only) Instead of using username and password you can also authenticate using your API-token (also known as API-key). You can look up your current current API-token in your account settings in the Data Station user interface. The API-token is specified using the header X-Dataverse-key . To pass it to the example programs using the run-*-deposit.sh scripts specify instead of your user name the literal string API_KEY and instead of your password the API-token. Note that using the API-token is the only way to authenticate if your Data Station account is using an external identity provider such as SURFconext or Google. Output analysis \u00b6 In the introduction the SWORD2 deposit process is described in 5 stages, the response messages give some indication how far the process has progressed. The output will take the following form, starting with the part of the response representing step 2. The UUID will of course be different. SUCCESS.

This confirms that the dataset was successfully published and is resolvable using the DOI URL https://doi.org/doi:10.5072/DAR/MNGAHF . (N.B. in the test environment the DOI will not actually resolve.) The DOI can be used to cite the dataset. The dataset has the URN:NBN identifier urn:nbn:nl:ui:13-d4cfb364-c6cc-4242-891a-e9e9673379bc . This can be used be the depositor to retrieve a summary from the DANS Data Vault for this dataset. The summary includes information about for which dataset versions a long term preservation copy exists in the Vault. The Bag ID for this version of the dataset is urn:uuid:ca145147-6d15-4c2b-abf0-fb1110271560 . The Bag ID serves as a unique identifier for a long term preservation package in the DANS Data Vault. Output for a failed deposit \u00b6 If you deposit a bag that does not comply with the DANS BagIt Profile v1 requirements, a state of REJECTED will be returned. For example, when you use the example bag in src/main/resources/example-bags/invalid/two-available-dates , the error will indicate that a second ddm:available element was found where a ddm:audience was expected: Checking deposit status ...

State Description DRAFT The deposit is being prepared by the depositor. It is not submitted to the archive yet and still open for additional data. UPLOADED The deposit is in the process of being submitted. It is waiting to be finalized. The data is completely uploaded. It will automatically move to the next stage and the status will be updated accordingly. FINALIZING The deposit is in the process of being submitted. It is being checked for validity. It will automatically move to the next stage and the status will be updated accordingly. INVALID The deposit is not accepted by the archive as the submitted bag is not valid. The description will detail what part of the bag is not according to specifications. The depositor is asked to fix the bag and resubmit the deposit. SUBMITTED The deposit is submitted for processing. At this point the Ingest Flow is processing the deposit and will update the state when it finishes. FAILED An error occurred while processing the deposit REJECTED The deposit does not meet the requirements of DANS BagIt Profile v1 . The description will detail what part of the deposit is not according to specifications. The depositor is requested to fix and resubmit the deposit. PUBLISHED The deposit is successfully published in the Data Station repository (Data Station) . ACCEPTED The deposit has been accepted for preservation in the DANS Data Vault (VaaS) . If an error occurs the deposit will end up INVALID, REJECTED (client errors) or FAILED (server error). The text of the category element will contain details about the error. Next steps \u00b6 Studying the example bags \u00b6 After successfully depositing the first example to the demo repository you can start thinking about how to design your SWORD2 client. Depending on your source repository system this make take various shapes. In any case your code will need to assemble a bag conforming to DANS BagIt Profile v1 . Some examples of such bags are included in the resources directory of this project. Mapping rules \u00b6 The contents of the bags you deposit are mapped to data files and metadata in Dataverse. The mapping rules are documented in the Ingest Flow Mapping Rules Google spreadsheet. If you are a DANS SWORD2 customer access will be granted on request. Finding libraries and tools \u00b6 bagit-java \u2014a Java library for working with bags. This is a DANS fork of a project started by Library of Congress, which is no longer maintained by them. bagit-python \u2014a Python library and command line tool for working with bags, also by Library of Congress. This is still maintained by them. brew install bagit is still available on MacOS to install an older version of bagit-java which contained a powerful command line interface, but is no longer maintained. xmllint \u2014a tool to check that XML files conform to a given XML schema. Abdera project retired easy-sword2-dans-examples used the Apache Abdera library to parse Atom Entry and Feed documents. We have removed that dependency, because Abdera is no longer maintained and we do not recommend using unmaintained libraries. End-point for DANS BagIt Profile validation \u00b6 All bags that are deposited to a Data Station are validated by dd-validate-dans-bag to see if they conform to DANS BagIt Profile v1 . To facilitate faster development in the demo environment this service can be invoked directly. The example program nl.knaw.dans.sword2examples.ValidateBag demonstrates how to call this API. A helper script to start this program is also provided, see run-validation.sh . DO NOT make calling this API part of your production code! Use of the validation API end-point is entirely optional during testing. The Ingest Flow will call the validation before further processing a deposit, so if it is not valid it will be rejected. That having been said, when writing the code that assembles the bag to be deposited, using the validation API end-point may shorten the Edit - Compile - Run cycle. Testing different scenarios \u00b6 This project contains four Java example programs which can be used as a guide to writing a custom client to deposit datasets using the SWORD2 protocol. The examples take one or more bags as input parameters. These bags may be directories or ZIP files. The code copies each bag to the target -folder of the project, zips it (if necessary) and sends it to the specified SWORD2 service. The copying step has been built in because in some examples the bag must be modified before it is sent; this way we avoid changing the git working directory. SimpleDeposit.java sends a zipped dataset in a single chunk and reports on the status. ContinuedDeposit.java sends a zipped bag in chunks of configurable size and reports on the status. SequenceSimpleDeposit.java calls the SimpleDeposit class multiple times to send multiple bags belonging to a sequence, the first bag being a new dataset and subsequent bags being updates (new versions) of this dataset. SequenceContinuedDeposit.java calls the ContinuedDeposit class multiple times to send multiple bags belonging to a sequence, the first bag being a new dataset and subsequent bags being updates (new versions) of this dataset. The Common.java class contains elements which are used by all the other classes. This would include parsing, zipping and sending of files. The project root directory contains several helper scripts ( run-*.sh ) that can be used to invoke the Java programs. See SYNOPSIS . These scripts were developed to run in a bash or zsh shell, but should be easy to adapt for a different shell environment. EXAMPLES \u00b6 Java Example programs . Example bags can be found in the resources directory .

However, a couple of things have changed that will require a change to the client code or configuration. Also, there are some added features. What follows is a list of all the changes. Optional ones are marked as such. Data Station vs Vault as a Service Clients can deposit to either a Data Station or the Vault as a Service (Vaas). The protocol is largely the same. The differences are highlighted in the text with the notes (VaaS) and (Data Station) . Service URL \u00b6 The service URL has changed from https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/sword2/collection/1 to a Data Station specific URL: https://sword2.archaeology.datastations.nl/collection/1 https://sword2.ssh.datastations.nl/collection/1 https://sword2.lifesciences.datastations.nl/collection/1 https://sword2.phys-techsciences.datastations.nl/collection/1 For the Vault as a Service the URL is: https://sword2.vault.datastations.nl/collection/<client_name> The client_name is provided by DANS and is unique for each client. Test deposits must be sent to the demo-server, which is hosted at the \"demo\" subdomain of the Data Station, e.g., https://demo.sword2.archaeology.datastations.nl/collection/1 . Since this is a test environment, this server is protected with an extra authentication header which is provided to our customers via a different channel. DDM schema changes \u00b6 New DANS Dataset Metadata schema and URI \u00b6 A new version of DANS Dataset Metadata has been introduced. To indicate that it is using the new schema the dataset.xml file in the deposit must use the new namespace: http://schemas.dans.knaw.nl/dataset/ddm-v2/ . Deposits containing a legacy-version dataset.xml will be rejected. New profile element: ddm:personalData \u00b6 The profile element has a new, required element, that provides a statement about the presence of personal data in the dataset. It must be added as the last sub-element of profile . It has one required attribute present , which takes one of the following values: Yes , No , Unknown . Example: <ddm:profile> <!-- other profile elements --> <ddm:personalData present=\"No\"/> </ddm:profile> Exactly one license element with xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\" \u00b6 There must be exactly one element with an xsi:type attribute set to dcterms:URI . Supported licenses (Data Station) \u00b6 The element text containing the URI of one of the licenses supported by the Data Station. The supported licenses can be retrieved from the Data Station API for example: curl https://archaeology.datastations.nl/api/licenses | jq '.data[].uri' The use of jq to extract the URIs from the resulting JSON is optional, of course. Note, that in EASY SWORD2 some deviations from the license URI were allowed (for example both http and https as URI scheme were accepted). In Data Station SWORD2 you must provide the license URI identical character by character as in the list of supported licenses. Supported licenses (VaaS) \u00b6 The Vault as a Service only requires a license to be specified. It does not have a list of supported licenses, so any license URI is accepted. New element ddm:datesOfCollection (optional) \u00b6 The ddm:dcmiMetadata section of DDM supports a new element ddm:datesOfCollection that allows you to specify the start and end dates for the date of collection. This will then be mapped to the Dataverse Citation Metadata field \"Date of Collection\" which is a structured field with Start and End subfields. In ddm:datesOfCollection the start and end dates must be entered in the element text, separated by a slash. The dates must be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD Example: <ddm:dcmiMetadata> <!-- other elements --> <ddm:datesOfCollection>2018-01-02/2018-05-01</ddm:datesOfCollection> <!-- other elements --> </ddm:dcmiMetadata> New element ddm:language (optional) \u00b6 The ddm:dcmiMetadata section of DDM supports a new element ddm:language that allows you to specify the language of the dataset in the attribute code . This will then be mapped to the Dataverse Citation Metadata field \"Language\". The supported encoding schemes are ISO639-1 and ISO639-2 ; which one is used must be specified in the attribute encodingScheme . For the list of supported codes see the wikipedia page on ISO 639 . Note, that the element text can be specified, but is not checked against the code, nor is it mapped to any Dataverse field. Example: <ddm:dcmiMetadata> <!-- other elements --> <ddm:language encodingScheme=\"ISO639-1\" code=\"fy\">West-Fries</ddm:language> <ddm:language encodingScheme=\"ISO639-2\" code=\"kal\">Groenlands</ddm:language> <ddm:language encodingScheme=\"ISO639-2\" code=\"baq\">Baskisch</ddm:language> <!-- other elements --> </ddm:dcmiMetadata> dc:language not mapped (Data Station) In EASY SWORD2 the element dc:language was mapped to the EASY metadata field \"Language\" for a very limited set of languages. This is no longer the case. If you want to specify the language of the dataset, you must use the new element ddm:language . File and directory names are sanitized (no action required) (Data Station only) \u00b6 Dataverse has specific rules about what characters it allows in file names and directory names. file names: all allowed except : : , * , ? , \" , < , > , | , ; , # ; directory names: only the following allowed : alphanumeric characters from ASCII, _ , - , . , \\ , (space) All forbidden characters are replaced with an underscore by Ingest Flow, so it is not necessary for the client to change any file or directory names. The original file and directory name are recorded in the file's description metadata in Dataverse, e.g. original_filepath: path/with/str\u00e6nge/<chars> Organizational identifier (optional) \u00b6 The client now has the option to provide an organizational identifier. The Depositor Organization most likely assign its own identifier to its datasets. It is highly recommended to store this identifier with the dataset deposited in the Data Station, so that it can be more easily correlated with the information in the client's repository or database. This is done using two elements in bag-info.txt : Has-Organizational-Identifier and, if available, Has-Organizational-Identifier-Version . For example: Has-Organizational-Identifier: REPO1:1234 Has-Organizational-Identifier-Version: 1 REPO1 is an organization specific prefix that must be agreed on with DANS beforehand. In this case 1234 would be the unique identifier that the REPO1 organization uses to reference the corresponding dataset. The version has no constraints and can be left out, if no such information is kept by the Depositor Organization. See also DANS BagIt Profile, Section 4 . Final deposit state changed to PUBLISHED (Data Station) and ACCEPTED (VaaS) \u00b6 The final state of a deposit in EASY was ARCHIVED . This has changed to the state PUBLISHED for the Data Stations and ACCEPTED for the Vault as a Service. The meaning is still that the client can stop tracking the deposit and rest assured that archiving in the DANS Data Vault will occur in due course. Original metadata is stored as original-metadata.zip (Data Station only) \u00b6 The DDM schema allows you to include any DCTERMS element you wish in the section ddm:dcmiMetadata section. However, not everything is mapped to Dataverse metadata. To ensure that the originally deposited metadata is not lost, it is saved in an uncompressed ZIP-file in the dataset, called original-metadata.zip . It includes dataset.xml and files.xml . Files outside the data folder are not archived \u00b6 The EASY SWORD2 Service stored any files it did not process in the archive \"as is\". The Data Station SWORD2 Service will not store any files outside the data folder of the bag (except for the original metadata: see previous section).","title":"Migrating from EASY"},{"location":"migrating-from-easy/#migrating-from-easy-to-a-data-station-or-vault-as-a-service","text":"The Data Station SWORD2 service is mostly compatible with the legacy EASY SWORD2 service.
